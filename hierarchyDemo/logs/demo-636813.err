Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
